Host header is mandatory for HTTP/1.1 clients. "Host: www.googleapis.com" is a host header and "Connection: keep-alive" is a shared general header between request and response.

Request headers accept pre-fixed headers which indicate the acceptable media-types, languages and characters sets on the client. For example, from Host, Referar and USer-Agent identify details about the client that indicate that initiated the request. "Accept: */*" is a request header.

Response Headers are similar to request message, except for the status line and headers. "Vary, Server" etc are response headers.
